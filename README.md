The X Analyzer Framework (XAF) is a real-time data analysis system designed to support emergency services and disaster response teams by extracting actionable insights from large volumes of online content. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and geospatial analysis, XAF enables local authorities—such as firefighters and emergency responders—to identify, assess, and act on emerging natural disaster events more effectively.

Core Features:

Sentiment Analysis: Detects urgency, distress, and emotional tone in user-generated content to prioritize incidents that require immediate attention.

Geolocation: Extracts and maps location data from posts to pinpoint areas impacted by natural disasters, even when explicit coordinates are not provided.

Topic Detection: Uses machine learning to filter and retain only relevant posts related to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes, or storms.

Disaster-Focused Filtering: Ensures that only critical information is retained and noise is removed, improving signal clarity for first responders.

Automated Reporting and Visualization: Generates real-time reports and dashboards that summarize trends, affected areas, and severity to guide rapid deployment of resources.

Use Case:

By integrating XAF, local fire departments, emergency management agencies, and NGOs can improve situational awareness, reduce response times, and coordinate aid more effectively during natural disasters.
